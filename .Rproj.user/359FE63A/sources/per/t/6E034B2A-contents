## qPCR of Batch Fermentations

During Batch Fermentation 3 and 4, samples were taken in frequent order. After 7 hours and 24 hours an enrichment step was carried out according to the protocol. Goal of the enrichment step was to explore an overgrown of receiver strains eventually. This would help to detect horizontal gene transfer in the batch fermentation.

DNA extraction was carried out with the .FastDNA^tm^ Spin kit for soil. Quantification of gene copy numbers was evaluated through a standard curve of the gene of interest, unique sequence for the strain and antibiotic resistance gene sequence respectively, using the in house program from the qPCR machine (Light Cycler 480)

Raw data was screened manually and checked for consistency and correct melting temperature of the samples.

Technical replicates were pooled and sd was calculated (" in progress ") the biological replicates were ploted against the time, variation is indicated as a line. The plot which showing the change of concentration of the antibiotic gene is placed next to the concentration of the unique sequence sequence. the scales are fixed to compare change of the concentration of both genes. The condition were either only spiked with the strain of interest (ST) or with the strain and the antibiotics (++).

> higher concentration for both genes in the condition with Antibiotic, seems that AB pressure has an positive impact on growth

The same workflow was used to generate similar plot in the Batch fermentation 3, which the spiked strain was a *E.coli* strain, which is carrying the bla operon, encoding for multiple ab resistances, mostly against Glycopeptide.

## Horizontal gene transfer (HGT)

To see (HGT) directly, the ratio of antibiotic gene over the unique sequence should grow with time.
